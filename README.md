<h3>Hi, Nice to meet you 👋</h3>

<h3>I'm Rafie Aliefa Khana Kotjek,</h3>
<h4>But you can call me Rafie</h4>

<hr>

<p>I'm a junior front-end developer. I can use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java, and React JS and have experience with frameworks such as Material UI and CSS extensions like Sass. I decided to be a front-end developer because I'm interested in tech and like designing pages, so I started to pursue my career as a front-end developer.</p>

<h4>👦 About me:</h4>

- 🌱 I'm learning to be a front-end developer at Glints Academy
- 🏫 I'm currently studying at Bina Sarana Informatika University majoring in Informatics
